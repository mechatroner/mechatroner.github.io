            <h1>Row Wrapping In Tables</h1>
            <p>
                Recently there was a patch contributed to the Rainbow CSV extension in VSCode that was unconditionally
                disabling editor's word wrap feature. The intent was do disable it in "Virtual Align" mode only, but 
                unfortunatelly, it is not possible to disable it only when the columns are aligned.
                So at first I didn't think much about it, and acccepted the patch but then I realized that having the word wrap enabled
                is actually a useful feature when looking at wide tables that don't fit a single screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                Word wrap or "Row wrap" as we will call it here allows to see the whole row without scrolling horizontally.
                This is especially beneficial if for example you are interested in 2 columns that are far apart from each other
                (e.g. column #1 and column #20) and can't be seen together simultaneously. The problem with wrapping the rows is
                that now it makes it harder to read the table because it's harder to see which cell belongs to which column.
                But with distinctive color highlighting or decorations for either all columns or only the columns of interest
                (column #1 and column #20 as in our example) it becomes easy again.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was actually using "Row wrap" feature all the time in my Vim Rainbow CSV setup without realizing,
                probably because I have word-wrap enabled by default in Vim but not in VSCode.
                So I had to revert the part of the patch that was disabling the word wrap and also added a feature to decorate up to 3
                columns of interest with borders, this really helps because after 10 columns the syntax colors start to repeat.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another way to facilitate Row Wrapping is to use alternate colors for the logical records which can now 
                consists of multiple physical rows. This feature was also recently added to Rainbow CSV and I hope would get some
                traction with the users.
            </p>
            <p>
                A true "Row Wrapping" would probably wrap the rows at the cell boundaries but in VSCode it is based on the editor's word wrap
                feature which is obviously not aware of the table structure.
