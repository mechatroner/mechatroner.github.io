            <h1>How I made this site</h1>
            <p>
                I thought it would be nice to have a low-effort way to write blog posts, 
                sometimes I have unusual thoughts or ideas and I am in the mood to write them down.
                I also wanted to avoid any kind of blogging platforms like Medium or Twitter because I am not really sure who 
                would actually own the content and just the idea of writing something there has started to make me feel somehow 
                uncomfortable in the last year or two, can't really describe the feeling.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I decided to make my own blog. At first I was thinking about using a static site generator like Jekyll or Hugo,
                I tried Hugo but it was a major disappointment for me. The project itself seems well supported and documented so I don't worry about its future.
                Also hugo is written in Go which I really like and you can just download a single binary and run it without any installation.
                What put me off is that in order to use it one would also have to adopt one of the Hugo themes and I didn't particularly liked any of them.
                Plus the themes themselves are just huge - I downloaded a couple of them and the average size of a theme was around 10-20MB which is completely unwarranted IMO.
                Also when I run the hugo command to actually generate the site it said in the report that 1000+ assets were generated which is just crazy. 
                Maybe I am missing something and not all of them are necessary for the final site upload but still.
                And to use Jekyll I would have to install Ruby which I never used before and some additional ruby scripts, so I didn't even try it after my Hugo debacle.
                Also both with Hugo and Jekyll I can't just write my posts in markdown and let the framework do the rest for me, apparently I would also have to learn 
                a templating language ("Liquid" for Jekyll or Go templating for Hugo) which is not a very transferable skill and learn a bunch of other hugo-related stuff, 
                so why not just write the whole stuff in HTML directly? This way I get much more control if needed, plus it is more fun.
            </p>
            <p>
                So what I ended up doing - I just asked Gemini to generate a simple HTML template for me and it sort of worked out.
                I adjusted it a little bit and added some JavaScript to generate the navigation bar (also mostly done by Gemini) and that is it.
            </p>

                For hosting I choose GitHub Pages because it is free and I am already using GitHub for my rbql website.
                I was also considering serving it from a gcp bucket but it seems like in order to set up https I would have to pay for a public IP address which is not free somewhere around 10$-30$ / year.
                So although it would be fun to try something new I decided to stick with GitHub Pages for now.
