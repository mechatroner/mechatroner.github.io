RBQL - RainBow Query Language
</h1>
<div class="description_paragraph">
    <span class="generic_description">
    RBQL is a technology which provides SQL-like language that supports SELECT and UPDATE queries. It is an ideal tool for data-transformation and data-analysis tasks on small and medium-sized data sets. RBQL query is executed using one of the backend languages. Currently &quot;Python&quot; and &quot;Javascript&quot; are available, but more backend languages can be added in the future. The first word &quot;Rainbow&quot; in RBQL reflects it's diverse multi-language nature. RBQL multi-backend design alows usage of non-SQL expressions inside SQL statements, e.g:
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span class="code_snippet">select top 100 a1, a2 * 10, a4.length where a1 == &quot;Buy&quot; order by parseInt(a2)</span><span> - for Java Script backend</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span class="generic_description">
    Combination of SQL statements and expressions from a different language makes RBQL very easy to learn and use: you just need basic understanding of SQL and one of the available high-level backend languages. So there is a high chance that you alread know RBQL!
    <br>
    RBQL has minimalistic modular design. It doesn't have any dependencies, the only thing it needs is presence of the backend language interpreter/compiler. To use RBQL with Python you need to have python installed in your system, and to use RBQL with JavaScript you need Node.js
